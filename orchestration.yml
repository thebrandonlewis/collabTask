# Orchestration Rules
orchestration_rules:
  parallel_execution:
    - "UI design system and backend setup can run in parallel"
    - "Authentication and task management can be developed in parallel"
    - "Testing and bug fixes can overlap with feature development"
    
  sequential_requirements:
    - "Repository setup must complete before any development"
    - "Authentication must be implemented before task management"
    - "Data sync must be implemented before offline support"
    - "All features must be complete before quality assurance"
    
  quality_gates:
    - "Each phase must pass quality gates before proceeding"
    - "Code review required for all major features"
    - "Testing coverage must meet minimum requirements"
    - "Performance benchmarks must be met"

# Risk Mitigation
risk_mitigation:
  technical_risks:
    - risk: "Real-time sync complexity"
      mitigation: "Start with simple sync, iterate to real-time"
      contingency: "Fallback to manual refresh if needed"
    
    - risk: "iOS App Store approval"
      mitigation: "Follow Apple guidelines strictly, test thoroughly"
      contingency: "Address feedback quickly, resubmit promptly"
    
    - risk: "Strapi backend scalability"
      mitigation: "Use managed hosting, monitor performance"
      contingency: "Upgrade hosting plan if needed"
  
  timeline_risks:
    - risk: "Feature development taking longer than expected"
      mitigation: "Prioritize MVP features, defer nice-to-haves"
      contingency: "Extend timeline or reduce scope"
    
    - risk: "Testing and bug fixes taking too long"
      mitigation: "Test continuously, fix bugs early"
      contingency: "Focus on critical bugs only"
  
  quality_risks:
    - risk: "Performance issues on older devices"
      mitigation: "Test on various devices, optimize early"
      contingency: "Reduce features or optimize further"
    
    - risk: "Accessibility compliance issues"
      mitigation: "Design with accessibility in mind from start"
