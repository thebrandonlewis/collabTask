- **User Personas**: 4 validated user personas (Students, Team Leads, Freelancers, Families)
- **Feature Roadmap**: Prioritized MVP features with Phase 2+ roadmap
- **Success Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics for adoption, engagement, retention, and quality
- **Technical Architecture**: React Native + Strapi + iOS deployment strategy

#### **Project Structure Created**
- **React Native App**: Complete iOS app structure with navigation
- **Redux Store**: State management with auth, task lists, tasks, and UI slices
- **Service Layer**: API services for authentication, task lists, and tasks
- **Navigation**: Stack and tab navigation with authentication flow
- **Screens**: Login, register, task lists, task detail, create task, and profile screens

#### **Core Features Implemented**
- **Authentication Flow**: Login, register, and forgot password screens
- **Task List Management**: View, create, and manage task lists
- **Task Management**: Create, view, and manage tasks with time estimates
- **User Interface**: Dark theme with intuitive, accessible design

## 📋 **Orchestrator Contracts**

The project follows a structured approach with orchestrator contracts:

- **`JTBD.yml`**: Job-to-be-Done contract with goals, audiences, and constraints
- **`actions.yml`**: Action definitions for all development tasks
- **`orchestration.yml`**: Phase management and resource allocation
- **`gates.yml`**: Quality gates and success criteria

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Adoption Metrics**
- Sign-ups: # of new users in first 30 days
- Activation: % of users who create first task list
- Onboarding: % of users who complete setup flow

### **Engagement Metrics**
- Task Creation: Avg. tasks created per active user per week
- Completion Rate: % of tasks marked as completed
- Session Duration: Avg. time spent in app per session

### **Quality Metrics**
- Test Coverage: ≥70%
- App Store Rating: ≥4.0
- API Uptime: >95%
- Crash Rate: <5%
