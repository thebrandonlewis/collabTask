# Step 2: Feature Planning - Prioritize What Matters 📊

**Now that we know the problem and users, let's decide what features to build first.**

---

## 🎯 **What You'll Define**

By the end of this step, you'll have:
- ✅ **Feature prioritization matrix** - What features matter most?
- ✅ **MVP definition** - What's the minimum viable product?
- ✅ **Development roadmap** - What to build first, second, third
- ✅ **Feature dependencies** - What needs to be built before what?

**Time needed: 15 minutes**

## 📋 **What You Need**

Make sure you have:
- [ ] **Problem statement** from Step 1
- [ ] **User personas** from Step 1
- [ ] **User journey maps** from Step 1
- [ ] **15 minutes** for feature planning

**That's it!** We'll guide you through everything else.

### **Step 2: Feature Prioritization** 📊
*Time: 5 minutes - **YOU DO THIS***

**🎯 What you'll do:**
1. **Review generated feature list** from Step 1
2. **Prioritize features** by user value and business impact
3. **Define your MVP** (Minimum Viable Product)
4. **Set development phases** (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3)

**🤖 What Cursor will do:**
- Create feature prioritization matrix
- Define MVP based on user value
- Generate development roadmap with phases
- Plan feature dependencies and sequencing

**🤖 Cursor Prompt Template:**
```
**Context**: Feature prioritization and MVP definition for mobile app
**Project Details**:
- App Concept: [YOUR APP]
- Feature List: [FROM STEP 1]
- User Personas: [FROM STEP 1]
- Business Goals: [WHAT ARE YOUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES?]
- Timeline: [HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO BUILD THIS?]

**Requirements**:
- Prioritize features by user value and business impact
- Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Create development roadmap with phases
- Plan feature dependencies and sequencing

**Deliverables**:
- Feature prioritization matrix
- MVP definition and rationale
- Development roadmap with phases
- Feature dependency map
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
```

**What you do**: Define your business goals and timeline constraints
**What Cursor does**: Creates prioritized roadmap and MVP definition

3. **Define authentication strategy** based on your features
4. **Set data requirements** for your features

**🤖 What Cursor will do:**
- Generate complete technical architecture
- Choose optimal technology stack
- Plan authentication and security strategy
- Design data models and API structure

**🤖 Cursor Prompt Template:**
```
**Context**: Technical architecture planning for mobile app
**Project Details**:
- App Concept: [YOUR APP]
- Feature Roadmap: [FROM STEP 2]
- MVP Features: [FROM STEP 2]
- Target Platforms: [iOS/Android/Both]
- Expected Users: [HOW MANY USERS DO YOU EXPECT?]

**Requirements**:
- Define technical architecture
- Choose appropriate technologies
- Plan authentication strategy
- Design data models and API structure
- Plan deployment and scaling strategy

**Deliverables**:
- Technical architecture diagram
- Technology stack recommendations
- Authentication and security plan
- Data model specifications
- API design and documentation
- Deployment and scaling strategy
```

**What Cursor does**: Automatically generates complete technical architecture

## 💡 **Feature Planning Best Practices**

### **Prioritize by User Value**
- **Focus on core problems** - What do users need most?
- **Validate assumptions** - Test feature ideas with users
- **Measure impact** - Track how features affect user behavior

### **Define Clear MVP**
- **Minimum viable** - Just enough to solve the core problem
- **Viable** - Good enough that users will actually use it
- **Product** - Something users will pay for or recommend

### **Plan for Growth**
- **Scalable architecture** - Can handle more users and features
- **Modular design** - Easy to add new features
- **Performance optimization** - Fast and responsive user experience

### **Manage Dependencies**
- **Foundation first** - Build core systems before advanced features
- **User flow** - Features that work together seamlessly
- **Technical dependencies** - What needs to be built before what
