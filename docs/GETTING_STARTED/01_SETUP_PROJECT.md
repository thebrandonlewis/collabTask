## ðŸ’¡ **Implementation Best Practices**

### **Trust the Automation**
- **Let Cursor work** - Don't interrupt the automation process
- **Review the results** - Check that everything looks right
- **Ask questions** - If something doesn't make sense, ask Cursor
- **Provide feedback** - Help Cursor improve the implementation

### **Focus on Strategy**
- **Your role is strategic** - Define what to build and why
- **Cursor's role is technical** - Handle all the implementation
- **Stay user-focused** - Keep thinking about your users
- **Measure success** - Track how your app performs

### **Plan for Iteration**
- **Start with MVP** - Get core features working first
- **Gather feedback** - Test with real users
- **Iterate quickly** - Use Cursor to make improvements
- **Scale gradually** - Add features as you validate demand
