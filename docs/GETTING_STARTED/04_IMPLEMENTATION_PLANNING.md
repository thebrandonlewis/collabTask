Your strategic planning outputs directly populate the orchestrator contracts:

#### **Strategic Planning → JTBD.yml**
- **Problem Statement** → `goals` and `non_goals`
- **User Personas** → `audiences` and target users
- **Success Metrics** → `constraints.budget` and quality thresholds
- **Business Objectives** → `owner` and `approvers`

#### **Feature Planning → actions.yml**
- **Feature Roadmap** → `actions` task definitions
- **MVP Features** → Core actions for P1-P3 phases
- **Advanced Features** → Actions for P4-P7 phases
- **Dependencies** → Action sequencing and prerequisites

#### **Technical Strategy → orchestration.yml**
- **Architecture Decisions** → Phase definitions and run modes
- **Deployment Strategy** → Release and deployment actions
- **Quality Requirements** → Testing and validation actions
- **Timeline** → Phase scheduling and milestones

#### **Success Metrics → gates.yml**
- **User Metrics** → Quality gates for user experience
- **Technical Metrics** → Performance and reliability gates
- **Business Metrics** → Success criteria and budget controls
- **Monitoring** → Analytics and tracking gates

### **Blueprint Phase Mapping**
- **P0 Setup** → Project initialization and contracts
- **P1 Discovery** → Strategic planning validation
- **P2 Planning** → Feature roadmap implementation
- **P3 Design** → Technical architecture implementation
- **P4 Build** → Core feature development
