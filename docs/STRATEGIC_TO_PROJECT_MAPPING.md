# Strategic Planning → Project-Specific Requirements Mapping 🗺️

**How strategic planning outputs inform FlirtIO-specific requirements and orchestrator contracts**

---

## 🎯 **Overview**

This document shows how your strategic planning outputs directly populate the project-specific requirements that build on the Project System Process Blueprint foundation.

---

## 🔄 **Mapping Flow**

```
Strategic Planning → Project-Specific Requirements → Orchestrator Contracts → Implementation
```

### **Step 1: Strategic Planning Outputs**
- Problem definition
- User personas  
- Feature prioritization
- Technical strategy
- Success metrics

### **Step 2: Project-Specific Requirements**
- FlirtIO customizations
- Service configurations
- Feature implementations
- User experience flows

### **Step 3: Orchestrator Contracts**
- JTBD.yml (goals, audiences, constraints)
- actions.yml (task definitions)
- orchestration.yml (phase mapping)
- gates.yml (quality criteria)

### **Step 4: Implementation**
- Automated development
- Quality gates
- Project management
- Success tracking

## 📋 **Detailed Mapping**

### **Strategic Planning → JTBD.yml**

| Strategic Output | JTBD.yml Field | Example |
|------------------|----------------|---------|
| Problem Statement | `goals` | "Friends struggle to coordinate group projects" |
| User Personas | `audiences` | `["iOS", "Android", "Web (secure vault)"]` |
| Success Metrics | `constraints.budget` | `tokens: 1_000_000` |
| Business Objectives | `owner` and `approvers` | `owner: @you`, `approvers: [@design, @englead]` |
| Non-Goals | `non_goals` | `["Realtime collab"]` |

**Example JTBD.yml generated from strategic planning:**
```yaml
project:
  name: CollaborativeTodoApp
  owner: @sarah
  approvers: [@design, @englead]
  goals:
    - "Friends can create and assign tasks together"
    - "Real-time task updates and notifications"
    - "Group project coordination and deadline management"
  non_goals:
    - "Complex project management features"
    - "Enterprise-level security"
  audiences: ["iOS", "Android"]
  constraints:
    budget:
      tokens: 500_000
      time_days: 14
    compliance:
      accessibility: WCAG_2_2_AA
```

### **Feature Planning → actions.yml**

| Feature Output | actions.yml Entry | Phase |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| MVP Features | Core task actions | P1-P3 |
| Advanced Features | Extended actions | P4-P7 |
| Dependencies | Action sequencing | All phases |

**Example actions.yml generated from feature planning:**
```yaml
actions:
  # P1 - Core MVP Features
  app.task_creation:
    summary: "Create and assign tasks with due dates"
    owner: @englead
    inputs: [mobile-app/**, services/**]
    outputs: [mobile-app/**, services/**]
    done_when:
      - "Users can create tasks"
      - "Users can assign tasks to friends"
      - "Due dates are enforced"
  
  app.real_time_updates:
    summary: "Real-time task updates and notifications"
    owner: @englead
    inputs: [services/**]
    outputs: [services/**]
    done_when:
      - "Tasks update in real-time"
      - "Push notifications work"
      - "Offline sync functions"
  
  # P2 - Advanced Features
  app.group_management:
    summary: "Group creation and member management"
    owner: @englead
    inputs: [mobile-app/**, services/**]
    outputs: [mobile-app/**, services/**]
    done_when:
      - "Users can create groups"
      - "Group invitations work"
      - "Group settings are configurable"
```

### **Technical Strategy → orchestration.yml**

| Technical Output | orchestration.yml Phase | Run Modes |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Architecture Decisions | Phase definitions | plan, dry_run, exec |
| Deployment Strategy | Release actions | exec only |
| Quality Requirements | Testing actions | dry_run, exec |
| Timeline | Phase scheduling | All modes |

**Example orchestration.yml generated from technical strategy:**
```yaml
phases:
  P1_core_features:
    plan:    [app.task_creation, app.real_time_updates]
    dry_run: [tests.run, app.task_creation]
    exec:    [app.task_creation, app.real_time_updates]
  
  P2_advanced_features:
    plan:    [app.group_management, app.analytics]
    dry_run: [tests.run, app.group_management]
    exec:    [app.group_management, app.analytics]
  
  P3_polish_and_release:
    plan:    [deploy.app_store]
    dry_run: [tests.run, deploy.app_store]
    exec:    [deploy.app_store]
```

### **Success Metrics → gates.yml**

| Success Output | gates.yml Gate | Threshold |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| User Metrics | Quality gates | User satisfaction > 4.5/5 |
| Technical Metrics | Performance gates | App load time < 2s |
| Business Metrics | Success criteria | 80% task completion rate |
| Monitoring | Analytics gates | Error rate < 1% |

**Example gates.yml generated from success metrics:**
```yaml
quality:
  accessibility: WCAG_2_2_AA
  lighthouse_min: 90
  tests_min_coverage: 0.70
  user_satisfaction_min: 4.5
  task_completion_rate_min: 0.80
  
budget:
  tokens_max: 500_000
  time_days_max: 14
  actions_on_over:
    - label: pause_generation
    - label: needs_human
    - notify: #slack-release
```

## 🏗️ **FlirtIO-Specific Requirements**

### **Service Configurations**

Based on strategic planning, FlirtIO-specific configurations are generated:

#### **Authentication Service**
```yaml
# Generated from user personas and security requirements
auth:
  providers: ["phone", "email", "apple", "google"]
  security: "2FA optional, encryption required"
  compliance: "GDPR, COPPA"
```

#### **Database Schema**
```yaml
# Generated from feature roadmap and user scenarios
database:
  tables:
    - users (personas, preferences)
    - tasks (creation, assignment, completion)
    - groups (collaboration, permissions)
    - notifications (real-time updates)
```

#### **API Endpoints**
```yaml
# Generated from feature prioritization and technical strategy
api:
  endpoints:
    - POST /tasks (create task)
    - PUT /tasks/:id (update task)
    - GET /groups/:id/tasks (group tasks)
    - POST /notifications (send notification)
```

### **User Experience Flows**

Based on user personas and scenarios:

#### **Onboarding Flow**
```yaml
# Generated from user personas and problem definition
onboarding:
  steps:
    - Welcome screen (problem introduction)
    - Account creation (authentication)
    - Group setup (collaboration)
    - First task creation (value demonstration)
```

#### **Core User Flows**
```yaml
# Generated from user journey maps and feature prioritization
flows:
  create_task:
    - Navigate to task creation
    - Fill task details
    - Assign to friend
    - Set due date
    - Confirm creation
  
  complete_task:
    - View assigned tasks
    - Mark as complete
    - Add completion note
    - Notify group members
```

### **Strategic Planning → Blueprint Phases**

| Strategic Phase | Blueprint Phase | Purpose |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Problem Definition | P1 Discovery | Validate problem and scope |
| User Personas | P1 Discovery | Define target audiences |
| Feature Planning | P2 Planning | Convert scope to actions |
| Technical Strategy | P3 Design | Architecture and presets |
| Implementation Planning | P4 Build | Execute development |
| Testing & Validation | P5 Hardening | Quality assurance |
| Deployment | P6 Release | Ship to users |
| Success Tracking | P7 Post-Release | Learn and iterate |

### **Phase Integration Example**

**P1 Discovery (Strategic Planning Validation)**
```yaml
# Strategic planning outputs validate Blueprint discovery
discovery:
  problem_validation: "Friends struggle with group coordination"
  audience_confirmation: ["college_students", "young_professionals"]
  scope_definition: "Task creation, assignment, completion, notifications"
  budget_allocation: "500_000 tokens, 14 days"
```

**P2 Planning (Feature Roadmap Implementation)**
```yaml
# Feature planning creates Blueprint actions
planning:
  mvp_actions: [app.task_creation, app.real_time_updates]
  advanced_actions: [app.group_management, app.analytics]
  dependencies: "Authentication before task creation"
  timeline: "P1: 7 days, P2: 7 days"
```
