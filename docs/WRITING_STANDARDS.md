# Documentation Writing Standards 📝

**Standards for creating consistent, effective documentation**

## 📋 Required Document Structure

### **Every Document Must Have**
1. **Quick Start** (5-minute overview)
2. **Prerequisites** (what you need)
3. **Detailed Steps** (complete process)
4. **Troubleshooting** (common issues)
5. **Related Resources** (next steps)

### **Optional Sections**
- **Reference Materials** (comprehensive details)
- **Advanced Topics** (edge cases and optimizations)
- **Feedback Section** (user input collection)

## ✍️ Writing Guidelines

### **Language & Style**
- **Use active voice**: "Create the file" not "The file should be created"
- **Be specific**: "Click the blue button" not "Click the button"
- **Use present tense**: "The system creates" not "The system will create"
- **Write for 6th-grade reading level**: Simple, clear language

### **Code Examples**
- **Include code for every step** that involves code
- **Use syntax highlighting**: Specify language in code blocks
- **Provide complete examples**: Don't assume prior knowledge
- **Include expected output**: Show what users should see

### **Structure & Formatting**
- **Use emojis for section headers**: 🎯, 🚀, 📖, 🔧, etc.
- **Number steps clearly**: 1, 2, 3, not bullet points for procedures
- **Use consistent terminology**: Same words for same concepts
- **Include table of contents** for documents longer than 20 sections

## 🎯 Content Guidelines

### **Quick Start Sections**
- **Maximum 5 steps**
- **Estimated time: 5 minutes**
- **Include immediate validation step**
- **Link to detailed implementation**

### **Detailed Implementation**
- **Step-by-step procedures**
- **Expected outcomes for each step**
- **Error scenarios and solutions**
- **Complete code examples**

### **Troubleshooting**
