## 👥 **Target Users**

### **Primary Audiences**
1. **Busy Students** - Group project coordination and deadline management
2. **Small Team Leads** - Delegation tracking and progress visibility
3. **Freelancers/Contractors** - Client communication and time tracking
4. **Families/Couples** - Household chore coordination and shared planning

### **User Scenarios**
- *"As a student, I want to split project tasks with my group so deadlines don't slip"*
- *"As a team lead, I want to see incomplete vs. completed tasks so I can check progress"*
- *"As a freelancer, I want to assign minutes to each task so clients know how long work will take"*
- *"As a parent, I want to share lists so everyone knows their responsibilities"*
