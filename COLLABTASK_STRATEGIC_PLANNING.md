# CollabTask Strategic Planning Document 🎯

**Project**: CollabTask - Shared Task Management for Teams  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: Strategic Planning Complete ✅

---

## ✅ **Clear Problem Statement**

**Problem**: People working together lose track of *"who's doing what, by when."*

**Solution**: CollabTask solves this by giving teams a **shared task list with clear time estimates and progress tracking**, synced between iOS and Strapi.

**Why It Matters**: 
- Teams waste time on miscommunication and missed deadlines
- Current solutions are either too complex (enterprise tools) or too simple (basic lists)
- Small teams need something in between: simple but with time tracking and progress visibility

---

## ✅ **Target User Personas**

### **1. Busy Students** 📚
- **Demographics**: College students, 18-25, managing group projects
- **Pain Points**: Group project coordination, deadline management, task distribution
- **Goals**: Split project tasks with group, track progress, meet deadlines
- **Tech Comfort**: High - comfortable with mobile apps

### **2. Small Team Leads** 👔
- **Demographics**: Team managers, 25-40, overseeing 3-8 person teams
- **Pain Points**: Delegation tracking, progress visibility, simple task management
- **Goals**: Delegate tasks, see what's incomplete vs completed, check progress
- **Tech Comfort**: Medium - prefer simple, intuitive tools

### **3. Freelancers/Contractors** 💼
- **Demographics**: Independent workers, 25-45, coordinating with clients
- **Pain Points**: Client communication, time tracking, deliverable management
- **Goals**: Assign minutes to tasks, show clients how long work will take
- **Tech Comfort**: High - need professional tools

### **4. Families/Couples** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **Demographics**: Households, 25-50, managing shared responsibilities
- **Pain Points**: Household chore coordination, shared planning, responsibility tracking
- **Goals**: Share lists, know responsibilities, track completion
- **Tech Comfort**: Medium - need simple, family-friendly interface

## ✅ **Job-to-be-Done Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Student Group Project**
*"As a student, I want to split project tasks with my group so deadlines don't slip."*

**Current State**: Using group chats, shared docs, but losing track of who's doing what
**Desired State**: Clear task list with assignments, time estimates, and progress tracking
**Success**: Project completed on time with clear accountability

### **Scenario 2: Team Lead Delegation**
*"As a team lead, I want to see incomplete vs. completed tasks so I can check progress."*

**Current State**: Asking team members for updates, unclear progress visibility
**Desired State**: Real-time dashboard showing task status and progress
**Success**: Clear visibility into team progress without constant check-ins

### **Scenario 3: Freelancer Client Work**
*"As a freelancer, I want to assign minutes to each task so clients know how long work will take."*

**Current State**: Estimating time verbally, unclear scope for clients
**Desired State**: Time-tracked tasks with client visibility
**Success**: Clear time estimates and client satisfaction

### **Scenario 4: Family Coordination**
*"As a parent, I want to share lists so everyone knows their responsibilities."*

**Current State**: Verbal reminders, forgotten tasks, unclear responsibilities
**Desired State**: Shared task list with clear assignments and completion tracking
**Success**: Household tasks completed without constant reminders
